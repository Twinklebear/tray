CS6620 Project 1 - Will Usher
=
The project should build easily with CMake but does require a C++11 compliant compiler.
I did choose to use TinyXML2 instead of TinyXML1, since the library is so small I've included its source under tinyxml2/
so there are no additional dependencies that need to be downloaded to build the renderer.
